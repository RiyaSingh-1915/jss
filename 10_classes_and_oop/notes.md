## 4 pillars
<!-- Abstraction -->
Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

ðŸ§  Think: You drive a car without knowing how the engine works internally.

<!-- Encapsulation -->
Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together in one unit â€” and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

_balance is not directly accessible â€” itâ€™s encapsulated inside the function.

<!-- Inheritance -->
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

Dog inherits name and makeSound from Animal and overrides it.


<!-- Polymorphism -->
Polymorphism means "many forms" â€” the same method behaves differently based on the object that calls it.

all objects have a draw() method, but the output depends on the object type.
